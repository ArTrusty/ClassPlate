## Installation/setup instructions
1. Clone Repo
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
## How to run the application
   1. ```bash
         npx expo start
      ```
   2. Log onto the local host url from terminal OR download Expo Go on an android phone
   note: Expo Go will only work if your phone and computer are connected via the same wifi. You can do npx expo start --tunnel if you cannot put both devices on the same wifi. Please note that this generates a new url everytime. Google login will no longer work for two reasons: 1. The url that is generated is not listed as an authorized redirect urI on Google Cloud and 2. Google Cloud does not accept urls that do not start with https.

   3. If you log onto the local host url with your laptop, right click on the website and press inspect. Press toggle device emulation at the top to visualize what the app looks like on a phone. 

   4. You also can not log in unless you are added as a test user on Google Cloud Console
